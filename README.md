# ccdc_test
This is my attempt at the CCDC senior test. I enjoyed the challenge because it was with a framework I like but since it was a senior challenge it tested me just enough. The program is not perfect as I still have a lot to learn but I am happy to accept feedback and make better programs in the future. Thanks!
